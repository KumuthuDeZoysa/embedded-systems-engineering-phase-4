## üîß **PART 1: Remote Configuration Demo (2 minutes)**

**[Screen: Configuration dashboard and ESP32 serial monitor side by side]**

**NARRATOR:** "First, let's demonstrate remote configuration. The device currently polls the cloud every 60 seconds for configuration updates."

### **Live Configuration Update:**

**[Open config_dashboard.html in browser]**

**NARRATOR:** "Using our web dashboard, I'll update the sampling interval from 5000ms to 3000ms and modify the register list."

**[Make changes in dashboard and click Update Configuration]**

**[Screen: Show ESP32 serial monitor]**

**NARRATOR:** "Watch the ESP32 logs - within 60 seconds, the device will:"
- üîç Poll for configuration updates  
- üì• Receive the new configuration
- ‚úÖ Validate and apply the changes
- üì§ Send acknowledgment back to cloud

**[Wait for logs to show config update]**

**Expected logs:**
```
[RemoteCfg] Polling for config updates...
[Config] Received update: sampling_interval=3000ms
[Config] Configuration applied successfully
[RemoteCfg] Sending acknowledgment...
```

**NARRATOR:** "Perfect! The device verified, applied the new configuration internally, and reported success. The acquisition scheduler is now using the new 3-second interval."

---

## ‚ö° **PART 2: Command Execution Demo (2 minutes)**

**[Screen: Cloud command interface and device logs]**

**NARRATOR:** "Next, we'll demonstrate command execution - the complete round-trip from cloud to device to inverter simulator and back."

### **Send Write Command:**

**[Use curl or dashboard to send command]**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/command/queue \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"device_id": "EcoWatt001", "action": "write", "target_register": "8", "value": 42.5}'
```

**NARRATOR:** "I'm queuing a write command to register 8 with value 42.5. Watch as the device:"

**[Screen: ESP32 serial monitor]**

**Expected sequence:**
```
[RemoteCfg] Checking for commands...
[Command] Received write command: reg=8, value=42.5
[Protocol] Writing register 8 with value 42.5
[Command] Command executed successfully
[RemoteCfg] Sending command result...
```

**[Screen: Cloud command results endpoint]**

**NARRATOR:** "And here's the cloud confirmation - the complete round-trip took approximately 3 seconds. The command was executed, verified on the inverter simulator, and the result reported back with full traceability."

## üîê **PART 3: Security Demonstration (1.5 minutes)**

**[Screen: Security monitor and server logs]**

**NARRATOR:** "Our security layer implements three critical features: HMAC authentication, encryption, and anti-replay protection. Let's see this in action."

### **Normal Authenticated Request:**

**[Screen: Show server logs highlighting security events]**

**NARRATOR:** "Every device request uses HMAC-SHA256 authentication. Notice these security log entries:"

**Expected logs:**
```
[SECURITY] EcoWatt001: hmac_verified - Nonce: 157
[SECURITY] EcoWatt001: nonce_validated - Previous: 156, Current: 157
[SECURITY] EcoWatt001: request_authenticated - Success
```

### **Replay Attack Demo:**

**[Run security demo script]**

```bash
python security_demo.py
```

**NARRATOR:** "Now I'll simulate a replay attack using an old message. Watch how the security layer detects and blocks it:"

**Expected response:**
```
[SECURITY] EcoWatt001: replay_attack_detected - Nonce: 145 (too old)
[SECURITY] EcoWatt001: request_rejected - Reason: Invalid nonce
HTTP 401: Authentication failed
```

**NARRATOR:** "Excellent! The system correctly identified the replay attack and rejected the request. This demonstrates our robust anti-replay protection."

## üîÑ **PART 4A: Normal FOTA Update (2.5 minutes)**

**[Screen: FOTA demo script and ESP32 monitor]**

**NARRATOR:** "Now for the main event - our secure firmware over-the-air update system. I'll start with a normal update from version 1.0.3 to 1.0.6."

### **Upload New Firmware:**

```bash
python fota_production_demo.py --demo normal --version 1.0.6 --size 35840
```

**NARRATOR:** "This uploads a 35KB firmware binary, calculates the SHA-256 hash, chunks it into 1KB pieces with HMAC authentication, and makes it available for download."

**[Screen: Show upload progress]**

**Expected output:**
```
üì¶ Uploading Firmware 1.0.6
‚úÖ Firmware uploaded successfully!
‚úÖ Cloud ready with 35 chunks
```

### **Monitor ESP32 Download:**

**[Screen: ESP32 serial monitor and demo script monitoring]**

**NARRATOR:** "The ESP32 checks for updates every 23 seconds. Watch as it detects the new version and begins the chunked download process:"

**Expected sequence:**
```
[FOTA] Checking for firmware updates
[FOTA] Current: 1.0.3, Available: 1.0.6 - Update needed
[FOTA] Starting chunked download...
[FOTA] Downloaded chunk 1/35 (2.9%)
[FOTA] Downloaded chunk 5/35 (14.3%)
...
[FOTA] Downloaded chunk 35/35 (100.0%)
[FOTA] Verifying SHA-256 hash...
‚úÖ [FOTA] Hash verification successful!
[FOTA] Writing to OTA partition...
[FOTA] Rebooting in 3 seconds...
```

**[Device reboots]**

**NARRATOR:** "After reboot, the device reports successful boot confirmation:"

```
[FOTA] Boot successful - Running version 1.0.6
[FOTA] Reporting boot status to cloud...
```

**NARRATOR:** "Perfect! The complete FOTA process demonstrates chunked download, integrity verification, controlled reboot, and boot confirmation - all with HMAC security."

---

## üîÑ **PART 4B: FOTA Rollback Demo (1.5 minutes)**

**[Screen: Continue with rollback demo]**

**NARRATOR:** "Finally, let's demonstrate the rollback capability by uploading corrupted firmware that will fail verification."

### **Upload Corrupted Firmware:**

```bash
python fota_production_demo.py --demo rollback --version 1.0.7 --size 35840
```

**NARRATOR:** "This upload includes intentionally corrupted data that will fail SHA-256 verification."

**[Screen: ESP32 monitor]**

**Expected sequence:**
```
[FOTA] Checking for firmware updates
[FOTA] Current: 1.0.6, Available: 1.0.7 - Update needed
[FOTA] Starting chunked download...
[FOTA] Downloaded chunk 35/35 (100.0%)
[FOTA] Verifying SHA-256 hash...
‚ùå [FOTA] Hash verification FAILED!
üîÑ [FOTA] Triggering rollback to version 1.0.6
[FOTA] Rollback completed - System stable
```

**NARRATOR:** "Excellent! The system detected the corruption, rejected the bad firmware, and safely rolled back to the previous working version. The device continues operating normally with version 1.0.6."

## üõ† **Troubleshooting**

### **If FOTA doesn't start:**
- Check ESP32 is connected to WiFi
- Verify Flask server is running on correct IP
- Ensure security configuration matches between device and server

### **If configuration update fails:**
- Check nonce synchronization 
- Verify Device-ID header is present
- Ensure JSON format is correct

### **If commands don't execute:**
- Verify device polls for commands every 60 seconds
- Check command format matches expected structure
- Ensure target register exists in configuration
